# Flashzilla

n this project we’re going to build an app that helps users learn things using flashcards – cards with one thing written on such as “to buy”, and another thing written on the other side, such as “comprar”. Of course, this is a digital app so we don’t need to worry about “the other side”, and can instead just make the detail for the flash card appear when it’s tapped.
